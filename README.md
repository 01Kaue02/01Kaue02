About Me
Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I currently work at a metalworking company as a production assistant, but my focus is on software development. I am a student of Systems Analysis and Development (ADS) at UNIP, and I am currently in my second semester of the course.

I started my programming journey with HTML and CSS, having already completed several practical projects. My next goal is to start studying JavaScript to expand my knowledge and skills.

I have a strong passion for front-end development and I believe this is the area where I will build my career. I am dedicating myself to entering the tech industry, and with continuous effort and learning, I am confident I will achieve this goal.

I currently live in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, SÃ£o Paulo, and I am looking for opportunities that will allow me to grow as a developer and apply my knowledge in practice.
